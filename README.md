Project Goal

This is a functional prototype built to demonstrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pre-trained Transformer models can be deployed as user-friendly tools to support financial decision-making. The core objective is to move beyond simple keyword counting and provide an accurate, domain-specific sentiment analysis for financial headlines and text.

Essentially, it's a tool to quickly check the emotional temperature of the market on a given piece of text, which is an increasingly important part of credit and market analysis.

Why FinBERT?

In the finance domain, general sentiment models often fail because jargon can be misleading. This project solves that by using FinBERT: FinBERT is a BERT-based model that has been further trained (fine-tuned) on a large corpus of financial text, making it highly accurate for industry-specific sentiment.

Accurate Classification: 

It classifies sentiment into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. This structured output is exactly what a financial analyst requires.

Proof of Concept (PoC): 

This project serves as a minimal viable product (MVP) to demonstrate the rapid deployment of a powerful, state-of-the-art model from the Hugging Face ecosystem.



Technical Stack & Features


1. Python is the Core Programming Language	Used for all scripting, logic, data manipulation, and deployment framework glue.

2. Streamlit is used for	Web Interface / Deployment which enables the rapid deployment of the Python script as an interactive web application/dashboard.

3. Hugging Face transformers provides a ML	Model which	provides the pipeline abstraction to easily load and run the pre-trained FinBERT model.

4. PyTorch is a Deep Learning Framework	which is the underlying framework required by the FinBERT model for high-performance tensor operations.

5. Pandas are used within Python to structure the text input and clean, organize, and display the final sentiment scores in a clean data frame.
